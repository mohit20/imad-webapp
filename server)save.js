					Long Short Term Network (LSTM) is an type of recurrent neural network, Recurrent
					Neural Network (RNN) architecture used in the field of machine learning. While stan-
					dard neural networks are feed-forward, LSTM has feedback connections from previous
					layers that connects the weights and learning of previous layers to the next layer.

					It can process multiple data points like images, and also entire sequences of data like video.
					A common LSTM unit is composed of an input gate, a cell , an output gate and a forget
					gate. The cell remembers data values over set time intervals and the three gates regulate
					the flow of information in and out of the cell.

					Financial aspects and stock costs are fundamentally dependent upon abstract recog-
					nitions about the securities exchange. It is close difficult to foresee stock costs to the T,
					inferable from the instability of variables that assume a noteworthy job in the develop-
					ment of costs.
